# binary_relation_extraction
Binary relation extraction for chemical and protein interactions from biomedical documents

In order to run scripts from scratch, please follow these:
* Install [Genia Sentence Splitter](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/y-matsu/geniass/)
* Download our pretrained binary relation extraction model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_eKPAAwug49JNlNneJoNVhl5VDMP1VH/view?usp=sharing) and run the relevant script to find related protein - compound pairs in ChemPROT. Put the model into a new folder named models
* Install [ChemProt](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/news/corpora/chemprot-corpus-biocreative-vi/) and put the dataset into a new folder named data
